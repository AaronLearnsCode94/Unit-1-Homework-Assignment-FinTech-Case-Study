# **VOLT Bank - A Case Study in Neo Banking**

---

## *Overview and Origin of VOLT Bank*

Volt Bank was founded and opened by CEO Steve Weston in 2017. Volt bank aims to deliver its customers a better banking experience by using innovative technology systems and data analytics to help deliver a new experience to customers looking to move away from traditional banking. Volt Bank has placed an emphasis on making banking a mobile first experience and is currently challenging many industry norms to provide an experience that not only there customers want to talk to about but most definitely will. The norms that Volt Bank aims to rectify are the norms becoming more synonymous with the big four, the norm of hiding certain fee's, normal to keep loyal customers on worse of deals, the norm of treating their customers like numbers, Volt Bank is making strides in rectifying all the norms of banking in Australia.

Becoming the first neobank certified as a data recipient under the the consumer data right (CDR) scheme, Volt Bank finds itself now joining the other major player in Australian such as NAB, Commonwealth Bank and Westpac, who also have the aforementioned certification as a data recipient. Volt Bank was officially given their RADI Licence in May of 2018. With this RADI licence is became the first new retail bank in Australia since early 1981, proving that traditional banking as we currently know it to on it's way out.

Volt Bank so far has received more than \\$70 Million Dollars in funding from various sources with their most recent funding of $15 million dollars being received from the Australian Finance Group to help Volt Bank distribute further white label products.

## *Business Activities*

Volt Bank has been extremely active over the years, from partnerships with brick and mortar stores such as Australia's famous "Cotton On" as well as partnerships with tech giants such as Microsoft as of last year. The aim for these partnerships is not only to help grow Volt Bank but to also allow Volt to focus on an issue currently facing people around the world and the need for financial services, previously only provided by the already estabished players in the banking world.

Previously financial services, such as mortgages, personal loans and variety of other finances have only been sought via the traditional banking system. Volt has recently begun to offer the services of "White-Label" products. White-Label products are services where the supplier provides the retailer with products however these are not labelled under the suppliers brand and allow the retailer to place their label on the product and then provide that service to their customer.

The recent partnership with Microsoft and LAB3 highlight Volt Bank's interest in the area of white-label products, originally the Founder and CEO Steve Weston had mentioned that "We have been overwhelmed with the level of demand from corporations to do that," that in this instance being the supply of white-label services.

Volt bank has also been heavily targeting the current banking landscape aiming to right the wrongs of traditional banking, from providing more technology based services to its clients all without the previous stigma that traditional banking has. The current customer bank for Volt Bank is unknown however in early 2020 that had amassed a waiting list of 40,000 potential clients.

Neobanks such as Volt are able offer a plethora of advantages over their competitors, some of these advantages include:

   1. Far more cost-efficient (with no physical assets to maintain or keep on, this allows for greater cost reduction for the company, something that traditional banks are unable to offer)
   2. More competitive interest rates, with the bank having smaller overheads it as able to offer better interest rates to their customers.
   3. Ability to start fresh, with traditional banks having systems in place that need maintenance and updates to keep up with current technology, with Neobanks such as Volt Bank they are able to open and start with the latest and greatest in Fintech services.
   4. And most importantly the mantra of not being like your old bank is leading customers through their doors. Banks have a well established less than desirable past, and Neobanks aim to make banking about the customer again.

Neobanks such as Volt are able to utilise Big Data technology as well as AI to help their customers manage their money better. These technologies when utilised can provide in app updates to notify customers as well as the bank in order to help them identify fraudulent and/or unusual transactions. Another obstacle to overcome for not only neobanks such as Volt but even traditional banks is the collection of data that could be extremely cumbersome for their employees to record. Dealing with millions of transactions a day is no easy task to record, this is where the use of technology based around Big Data is being utitlised to not only record information for the bank itself but also the customer. This data once collected can the be collated and assessed by AI technology to help with credit approval for things such as home loans, personal loans and anything in between.

## *Landscape* 

Volt Bank is situated in the banking sector and is commonly referred to as a Neobank. This is a landscape that is relatively new to Australia, however other neobanks have found immense success in other areas of the world most notably Europe and the UK. Regulations and funding with a smaller population make the opening of a neobank in Australia that little more challenging, however despite these challenges many Neobanks have been successful in receiving large amounts of funding and government approval.

Trends being seen across the Neobanking industry include the following:
   1. Ability to open accounts without the actual need to visit a physical branch.
   2. Financial services that are able to provide more transparent services to their customers.
   3. Offering improved financial technology knowledge to their customers.
   4. Useful and up to date analytics that are able to provided to not only customers but service providers as well, via the use of AI and advanced analytics.
   5. Improved cybersecurity measures.

As Neobanks are relatively new to Australian shores they not only face competition from each other but also from the big four (NAB, Commbank, ANZ and St George), these traditional banks still have a large market share of customers who are used to traditional banking however some competitors in the Neobank include that of 86 400, UP and Douugh.

## *Results*

The impact has been significant with clients that require quick turnaround for approval of their loans, because of the electronic nature of the delivery of documents and the use of docu-sign borrowers are able to electronically sign the return of their documents to Volt Bank enabling quick settlement. The main impact has been due to the speed of approving home loans, with Australiaâ€™s real estate market heating up and becoming competitive for not only buyers but sellers the quick turn around of these documents give Volt Bank a competitive edge over not only the traditional banking domain but other competitors in the NeoBank space such as 86 400 and Douugh.

Volt Bank has been able to so far measure its success through a number of metrics and trackers such as deposits from clients into their newly opened saving's accounts and the volume of home loans being approved, Volt Bank determines the success of it's home loans through markers such as longevity of the approved home loans. This means that the goal is to not have a high overturn of clients who seek better value one, two or even five years into the loan, the goal being to retain these clients for the lifespan of the loan.

Volt Bank has been taking strides over it's competitors and has been able to constantly provide a strong edge over its competitors. Example of this include Volt Bank acquiring Australian Mortgage Market Place in July 2021, the aim being to get hold of the software developed by AMM which is intelli-credit which would give Volt Bank a marked penetration into the electronic approval documentation and settlement of home loans. Other non-bank lenders, such as 86400 and Douugh who currently do not offer home loans, which is the area where the biggest margins and longevity of income streams are generated.

## *Reccomendations*

Although Volt Bank has made strides in providing mobile banking to customers all over Australia there are areas where I believe further product releases would benefit the company. I believe one item that would implement well with their customers given the current climate would be that of providing a digital wallet for cryptocurrencies as well as giving them access to exchanges to buy and sell cryptocurrency through their own application. Cryptocurrency has had a meteoric rise over the previous years, and with its close similarities in providing a service or asset that are both digitally based believe would be a perfect match. If they were to successfully partner with an Australian exchange such as Coinspot perhaps reduced fee's could be offered to Volt Bank customers, this would not only entice people to join the bank that are interested in Cryptocurrency but would also drive new traffic to the exchange they partnered with, in this scenario Coinspot.

The use of blockchain technology and smart contracts are synonymous with Cryptocurrency however if implemented in a Neobanking situation could be used to verify loans and repayments made against those loans as well, offering customers a detailed ledger of their repayments, this partnered with the return from the customer of profits potentially made through their partnership with Coinspot would offer a way to invest digitally and pay off physical asset investments at the same time.
